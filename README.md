## Description:
            The application is ment that to detect the accidents immediately and send the location  to the near hospitals and to make an alarm to the emergency officials .
 
## Problem:
now a days the main problem is facing to unable to detecct the blood through the sensors.we cant even know where the accident are happening and we cant even know whats the situation in that location.

##solution:
whenever the accidents happened it  detects throught sensors and the accident location sends to the near by hospitals  through the gps location and activate the auto-message to the emergency officials then,it can prevent the deaths
eg:the sensors can be detected through air bags,car tyres,bike tyres etc;
